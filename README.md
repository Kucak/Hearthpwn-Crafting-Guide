# hearthpwn.py - Hearthstone Crafting Guide
In this script, I aimed to count cards class by class and show which cards are the most frequently used in top decks of hearthpwn decks
  * script creates "druid.txt,hunter.txt..." files that include which class cards are mostly used by counts.
  * script process only standard decks, ignore wild and adventure decks
